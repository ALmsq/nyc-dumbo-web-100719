DESCRIPTION:It doesn't take a coke-addled genius to figure out why we celeb
 rate on this day! Why it is in honor of the world's greatest detective\, Sh
 erlock Holmes\, of course! This day honors the world-renowned sleuth whose 
 capers and adventures have inspired nearly every detective (real or fiction
 al) since. The day actually falls on the birthday of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
 \, who famously chronicled the detective's adventures.\n\nTo celebrate: Pay
  a visit to 221b Baker Street\, Holmes' fictional address\, which has been 
 adopted by the Sherlock Holmes Museum in London. If you can't make it there
 \, take in your favorite incarnation of the famous detective\, who stands a
 s the most portrayed character of all time.\n\n(Sherlock Holmes)
